Swagger 2.0 lets you define the following authentication types for an API:

- [Basic authentication](/docs/specification/v2_0/authentication/basic-authentication/)
- [API key](/docs/specification/v2_0/authentication/api-keys/) (as a header or a query string parameter)
- OAuth 2 common flows (authorization code, implicit, resource owner password credentials, client credentials)

Follow the links above for examples specific to these authentication types, or continue reading to learn how to describe authentication in general.

Authentication is described by using the `securityDefinitions` and `security` keywords. You use `securityDefinitions` to define all authentication types supported by the API, then use `security` to apply specific authentication types to the whole API or individual operations.

The `securityDefinitions` section is used to define all security schemes (authentication types) supported by the API. It is a name->definition map that maps arbitrary names to the security scheme definitions. Here, the API supports three security schemes named _BasicAuth_, _ApiKeyAuth_ and _OAuth2_, and these names will be used to refer to these security schemes from elsewhere:

``` yml
securityDefinitions:
  BasicAuth:
    type: basic
  ApiKeyAuth:
    type: apiKey
    in: header
    name: X-API-Key
  OAuth2:
    type: oauth2
    flow: accessCode
    authorizationUrl: https://example.com/oauth/authorize
    tokenUrl: https://example.com/oauth/token
    scopes:
      read: Grants read access
      write: Grants write access
      admin: Grants read and write access to administrative information
```

Each security scheme can be of `type`:

- `basic` for Basic authentication
- `apiKey` for an API key
- `oauth2` for OAuth 2

Other required properties depend on the security type. For details, check the [Swagger Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#securitySchemeObject) or our examples for [Basic auth](/docs/specification/v2_0/authentication/basic-authentication/) and [API keys](/docs/specification/v2_0/authentication/api-keys/).

After you have defined the security schemes in `securityDefinitions`, you can apply them to the whole API or individual operations by adding the `security` section on the root level or operation level, respectively. When used on the root level, `security` applies the specified security schemes globally to all API operations, unless overridden on the operation level.

In the following example, the API calls can be authenticated using either an API key or OAuth 2. The _ApiKeyAuth_ and _OAuth2_ names refer to the security schemes previously defined in `securityDefinitions`.

```yml
security:
  - ApiKeyAuth: []
  - OAuth2: [read, write]
```

Global `security` can be overridden in individual operations to use a different authentication type, different OAuth 2 scopes, or no authentication at all:

```yml
paths:
/billing_info:
  get:
    summary: Gets the account billing info
    security:
      - OAuth2: [admin]   # Use OAuth with a different scope
    responses:
      200:
        description: OK
      401:
        description: Not authenticated
      403:
        description: Access token does not have the required scope

/ping:
  get:
    summary: Checks if the server is running
    security: []   # No security
    responses:
      200:
        description: Server is up and running
      default:
        description: Something is wrong
```

### Using Multiple Authentication Types

Some REST APIs support several authentication types. The `security` section lets you combine the security requirements using logical OR and AND to achieve the desired result. `security` uses the following logic:

```yml
security:    # A OR B
  - A
  - B

security:    # A AND B
  - A
    B

security:    # (A AND B) OR (C AND D)
  - A
    B
  - C
    D
```

That is, `security` is an array of hashmaps, where each hashmap contains one or more named security schemes. Items in a hashmap are combined using logical AND, and array items are combined using logical OR. Security schemes combined via OR are alternatives â€“ any one can be used in the given context. Security schemes combined via AND must be used simultaneously in the same request. Here, we can use either Basic authentication or an API key:

```yml
security:
  - basicAuth: []
  - apiKey: []
```

Here, the API requires a pair of API keys to be included in requests:

```yml
security:
  - apiKey1: []
    apiKey2: []
```

Here, we can use either OAuth 2 or a pair of API keys:

```yml
security:
  - oauth2: [scope1, scope2]
  - apiKey1: []
    apiKey2: []
```

### FAQ

**What does \[ \] mean in _"securitySchemeName: \[ \]"?_**

`[]` is a YAML/JSON syntax for an empty array. The Swagger Specification requires that items in the `security` array specify a list of required scopes, as in:

```yml
security:
  - securityA: [scopeA1, scopeA2]
  - securityB: [scopeB1, scopeB2]
```

Scopes are only used with OAuth 2, so the Basic and API key `security` items use an empty array instead.

```yml
security:
  - oauth2: [scope1, scope2]
  - BasicAuth: []
  - ApiKeyAuth: []
```
